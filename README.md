# CipherSuiteX-Cryptography-and-Network-Security
Welcome to CipherSuiteX, a collection of cryptographic algorithms and implementations! This repository is designed to explore the intricacies of encryption and modern cryptography, offering a robust resource for security professionals and enthusiasts.

## Content
This repository includes the following cryptographic implementations and experiments:
- Symmetric Encryption
  DES: Implementing DES encryption and decryption using a 64-bit key size and 64-bit block size.
  AES: Implementing AES encryption and decryption with 64/128/256-bit key sizes and a 64-bit block size.
- Asymmetric Encryption
  RSA: Developing a cipher scheme using the RSA algorithm.
- Hash Functions
  MD5: Implementing an MD5 hash algorithm to find the Message Authentication Code (MAC).
  SHA-128 and SHA-256: Finding the MAC for a given message using SHA-128 and SHA-256, and measuring time consumption for varying message sizes.
- Digital Signatures
  Digital Signature Standard (DSS): Implementing DSS for verifying legal communicating parties.
- Key Exchange Protocols
  Diffie-Hellman: Designing a multiparty key exchange protocol and performing a Man-in-the-Middle attack.
- Secure Communication
  SSL: Developing a simple client-server application using SSL socket communication.
  SSH: Implementing a simple client-server model using telnet, capturing packets with tshark, and analyzing the transmitted data using a packet capturing     
  library. Comparing this with an SSH implementation.
- Web Security
  JSON Web Token: Developing a web application that implements JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- Classical Ciphers
  CRT, Vigen√®re cipher, Hill cipher, and other classical techniques explored in Assessment 1.
